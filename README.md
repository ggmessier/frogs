# Fun Frog Project Repository
This repository is for Geoff's various fun projects described in a bit more detail [here](https://lib.engineer/pages/diversions).  Much of my projects are frog themed due to a long time love of [Kermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog) and their [role in our ecosystems](https://www.naturewatch.ca/wp-content/biguploads/senior_guide_712.pdf).
