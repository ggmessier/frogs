# frogs - boards
All active boards are designed using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). `eagle` contains some legacy boards designed using Eagle.  My custom symbol library is located in `lib` and custom footprint library is in `lib/lib.pretty`.  On a new KiCad install, these custom libraries are added under the Preferences library but the symbol libraries must be added in the schematic editor and the footprint libraries added in the PCB editor.

## Directories

- `dAuratus`: AVR128DB28 MCU board.
- `ils-avr`: AVR128DB28 DIP board used for ENCM 369.
- `soil-moisture`: A capacitive soil moisture sensor.
- `tile`: Files used to tile multiple PCBs for fabrication.
